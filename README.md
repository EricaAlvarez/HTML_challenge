**# HTML_challenge**

  **Description:**
  
    Through this challenge, it is possible to interact with web content, which, in this case, was from an educational page. But it is possible to interact with different pages just by being careful with their private politics. 
  
  **Challenge assignment:**
  
    This code pertains to Module 11, which focuses on collecting data from websites using web scraping techniques.
    
  **Application:**
  
    Both deliverables start with the same principle: visiting one proposed website and scraping the HTML. After that, the difference is that the first deliverable focuses on reading the text information from the page, which is about the mars news, while the second deliverable interacts with a table of data and, after adding it to a dictionary, shows some graphs.

  **Instructions to use:**
  
  To be able to interact with the Jupyter Notebook inside this challenge, it is essential first to download the Chromedriver from the following link: https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/external.html, and just after adding it to the environment path, run the notebook.
